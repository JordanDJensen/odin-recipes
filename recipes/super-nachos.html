        <h5>Ingredient</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 package of taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 package restaurant-style tortilla chips</li>
            <li>1 cup of shredded sharp cheese</li>
            <li>1 can refried beans</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 can pitted black olive, drained and chopped</li>
            <li>4 green onions diced</li>
            <li>1 can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and 
                water and simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.</li>
        </ol>
